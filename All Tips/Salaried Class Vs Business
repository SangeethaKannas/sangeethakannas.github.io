What benefit do you get for paying huge taxes?
The answer is Nothing.
â­•
Salaried class pays huge taxes and in exchange for nothing.
You work day and night, work hard to earn and end up paying 30% of your salary as taxes. It means you work for the government for approximately 4 months in a year.
â­•
Do you have any way to not pay tax? NO. Because it gets deducted before coming into your account.
â­•
Have you ever thought where exactly are your taxes being utilised?
In distributing freebies, getting votes, in the pockets of corrupt politicians.
â­•
Businesses also pay taxes. But not to the extent to which a salaried class pays tax.
â­•
The majority of the rich always find a loophole in the system and go around the bush to save their taxes.
â­•
Recently Suhana Khan bought Agricultural Land. Do you really think she will do farming? No she won't. But she will never be questioned by the system.
And by showing income on this land, she can save loads of tax.
This is the way most of HNI's, politicians, riches work in India.
â­•
And who ends up paying for their leisure. You.

Hence this post is for you - The Salaried Class.

As Ashneer Grover said, it is a very unjust tax system in India. And it needs immediate attention.
If the same keeps going, "Rich will become more rich and poor will become poorer" will never stop in our country. Ashneer Grover

It's high time the government is ignoring this matter. It should equalize the tax payable for every individual. Be it 10% or 15% flat.
Otherwise you all will keep working for the government for 4 months in a year. ðŸ˜Œ
