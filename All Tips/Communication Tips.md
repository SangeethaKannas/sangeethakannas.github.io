## LEADING WITH EMPATHY


## TIP #1
Communicate Observations
When providing feedback to your employees, share observable behaviors not just your 
feelings or judgments.

Let’s see this in action:


BEFORE:
“Janelle is lazy that’s why her work is always late.”

AFTER:
“For the past two projects, Janelle has turned in her work late.”

Only make observations that you can account (past two). Using the term ‘lazy’ is a type of judgment. Instead, find out why Janelle is late.


## TIP #2 Feelings vs. Non-Feelings
Don’t mix up your feelings with expression of thoughts. We often confuse an observation with our actual feelings.


BEFORE:
    “I feel I didn’t get a fair deal in my annual review!”
AFTER:
    “I think my annual review was unfair and here’s a few reasons why...” 

Try to distinguish between the words that express your 
feelings and the words that describe what we think.

## TIP #3 Acknowledging Needs:
Acknowledging your needs for something to happen a certain way can help ease negative feelings. Good leaders are clear with what they need from others.
Let’s see this in action:


BEFORE:
    “You irritate me when you don’t double-check your spelling in our social media posts”
AFTER:
“I feel really embarrassed when spelling mistakes like that appear in our social media posts, because I want our company to project a professional image.” Judgments of others are expressions of unmet needs. When you express your needs clearly, you have a better chance of getting them met.


## TIP #4 Making Requests, Not Demands*
Work has plenty of demands on us. Requests are those things we would like to ask of each other to enrich our working relationships.
Let’s see this in action:
*Not to be confused with doing your job.

BEFORE:
“You liked my presentation, right?”

AFTER:
“Can you share your perspective on yesterday’s presentation, what went well and what could I improve on?”

Requests avoid vague or ambiguous phrasing, and uses only positive language.

Empathy makes us better communicators, because it helps us relay information that identifies and meets needs.
