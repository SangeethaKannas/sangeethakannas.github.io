The Candidate is always right

Problem Statement
A. Great Resignation Era last year threw (Exposed?!) challenges in “Attracting 
and Retaining Talent”
B. Many a candidates didn’t show up for interviews/or the hiring pursuit didn’t 
result in on boarding outcomes including “Last Minute drop outs “ despite 
accepting the offer despite best follow ups.
C. Lead time to hire had severely taken a hit and ultimately influenced the “time 
to market”/”Revenue Leakages” and intangibles such as “Burn out in the 
existing teams” and “Frustrated Hiring Teams”
D. Lot of noise , whining , moral policing questioning the integrity of “Last minute” 
drop outs . 
It pains ,but let’s call a spade a spade
A. A customer walks into a shop and after looking at various brands, products, 
zeroes in on a few and got them to the billing (in the process, there were 
some swaps also).
B. Post Billing and payment, has the liberty to return as per his/her choice. 
Shopping online mostly comes with ( 10 days returns are quite common).
C. Was the customer wrong? What changed? And most importantly “why”?
D. If one thinks that the customer is wrong, such businesses will go extinct.
E. When the customer is always right, why not the candidate?
Blissfully ignorant or prudently business vigilant
A. Consumers stop buying your product, because they have found a better choice.
B. Clients walk out of contracts as they have found value elsewhere.
C. Marriages are broken/Relationships are called out, it wasn’t working any more
D. Employees are bounced during the probation period and/or through their 
employment over a while.
E. Hard Reality is there’s no “Holy Grail” or “Holy Cows”.
F. It’s time to smell that coffee moment.
Zoom out and dig deep
A.Hiring doesn’t happen only during the fulfillment process , it happens all the time. As an 
employer, you are being judged by the employees all the time based on their “Employee 
experience”
B. There are cycles of “Talent Supply Chain “ situations and changing business/job market 
landscape.
C. No HR function (Actually there’s no HR function just owned exclusively by the HR department*) 
works effectively as a “Single facet”/”Silo”.
D. More offer drop outs syndrome mostly goes with More turn over syndrome. Check your Gross 
and net addition numbers through at least two business cycles where your EPS was great to worst 
relatively.., check out your employee referrals contribution metrics(Also look at how agile on the 
hygiene part of it..)
Approach
STOP
START
CONTINUE
STOP
A. Stop blaming the candidates, recruiters, agencies and the current generation etc. 
Stop Moral policing. Wake up to the reality ( The reality is no new by the way)
B. Stop luring and over selling the job/company excessively , pre and post the offer 
process, but start sensing (Seek more and sell less). More you sell, lesser you 
sense. You will buy surprises.
C. Accept the fact that “The candidate is always Right” and at full liberty to make 
choices related to one’s career decisions through their life.
D. Stop focusing on “Over nurturing the candidates” and “Under Nurturing the 
employees”
E. People issues are always best solved outside the conference rooms with more 
seeking than talking. Don’t expect solutions from leaders/managers.
F. Have a “Go to employees” strategy on the lines of “Go to market” strategy.
Start
A. Invest in Managers and turn them into enablers of people success. 
B. Invest in “Real time dashboards” and make performance metrics transparent. Don’t (ab)use 
them to micro manage people. Make Managers redundant.Mentor redundant Managers into 
“Subject Matter Experts” and “Enablers of people Success”. 
C. Align your rewards strategy based on accepting such transparent metrics as an input. 
Encourage Peer-Feedback
D. Treat all with dignity and respect, like the way you do for your new hires.
E. Practiced implied values have greater significance than the stated values that were never 
practiced, never demonstrated to influence “Employee experience”.
F. Make an appeal to employees earnestly and involve them in enabling that “Employee 
experience”. 
G. There’s no shortcut to outsmart employees, be honest, open, fair and transparent Ensure 
such honesty,openness, fairness and transparency is never compromised at all times at all 
levels. Develop Zero Tolerance and breathe it every day.
Continue
A. There must be something working for you as an employer unless you have vacant 
office bays.Find out what is working for you as an employer (Involve employees) and 
keep striving on those strengths. 
B. While you work on enabling that “Employee experience” , focus on “Branding and 
Reach” both internally and externally. Celebrate successes and share them with wider 
audience to create that aura. Going Digital is the key
B. To meet the practical need of fulfillment, have back ups in place while you sense the 
motives/probability (Involve employees). This is just a quick fix that works temporarily.
C. When the talent supply chain is overheated, you will bound to have “drop outs”, 
count them in the earlier stages of planning and “Anticipate Surprises” and factor them 
in to have a “plan B”.
Conclusion
A. In a holistic manner, as an employer what is the value proposition that you can offer to 
employees/ prospective employees? What is the differentiated offering that you have in store for 
your existing employees to stay.strive and succeed and the prospects to join the bandwagon.
B.Create your “Employer Value proposition” and you will not only attract talenbut also makes your 
job easier to sell your ideas to investors and customers. You become preferred.
C. “Engagement levels and levers” are changing. “Employer-Employee” relationship could cease 
to exist. Outcome based relationships are in the horizon. But the basics remain the same.
D. Live a dream or be prepared to be left out.
