## Keys to success

1. Hard work
 Don't believe in luch, believe in hard work. Stop trying to rush the process or searching for a shortcut.

2. Patience
	Losing the patience = Losing the battle
First nothing happens, then it happens slowly and suddenly all at once. most people give up at stage one

3. Sacrifice,
	If you don't sacrifice for what you want, then what you want becomes the sacrifice. Everything has its price, 
Are you ready to pay it for the life you desire?

4. Consistency
  It transforms average into excellence. Without it you will never achieve great success.

5/. Discipline
	Motivation gets you going, but discipline keeps you growing. There will be days when you don't feel like doing it. You have to push through these days regardless of how you feel.

6. Self confidence
 	Confidence is, I will be fine If they don't like me. There will always be someone judging you for who you are and what you want in life
