2 most important habits that helped me upskill :

ðŸ”¹Consistent efforts in spite of initial rejections. 
Remember, learning a new programming language, solving questions and working on projects, it all takes effort.

ðŸ”¹Fear to fail
Lately, I have been trying my hands at many new tools and platforms as a developer. I discovered and created apps using OTPLESS . One word, itâ€™s wonderful. âœ¨

I mean we humans are becoming smart in all spheres of life, so why stick to the old password and OTP login method. I think we all developers should start using OTPLESS to give a smooth experience to our users.
