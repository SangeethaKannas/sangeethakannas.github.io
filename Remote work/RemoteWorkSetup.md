INVEST IN YOUR REMOTE WORKSETUP


MYFIRST REMOTE WORK SETUP
In my early days of remote work, I set up shop at the kitchen table in an old wooden dining chair, or from the comfort of my bed, lying back with my computer on my lap.




MAKING THE SE
SIMPLE CHANGES
GAME-CHANGER

Comfy Desk & Chair: No more back pain, butt splinters, or accidental naps. Laptop Stand, Keyboard, & Mouse: Brings laptop closer to my eyes, helps ergonomics. 
Extra Screen: Separating my task and the
supportive resources is more productive.
Good USB Mic: Sounds professional and
never a doubt I can be heard clearly.
Clear Webcam: Looking sharp in every
meeting, plus you can see my dog in 1080.



FINAL THOUGHTS
It’s worth making an investment in your remote setup so you have the tools and equipment to stay focused, work comfortably, and collaborate effectively with others.
