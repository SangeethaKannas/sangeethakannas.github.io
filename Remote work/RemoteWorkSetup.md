# INVEST IN YOUR REMOTE WORKSETUP


## MYFIRST REMOTE WORK SETUP
In my early days of remote work, I set up shop at the kitchen table in an old wooden dining chair, or from the comfort of my bed, lying back with my computer on my lap.


MAKING THE SEAT
SIMPLE CHANGES
GAME-CHANGER

Comfy Desk & Chair: No more back pain, butt splinters, or accidental naps. Laptop Stand, Keyboard, & Mouse: Brings laptop closer to my eyes, helps ergonomics. 
Extra Screen: Separating my task and the supportive resources is more productive.
Good USB Mic: Sounds professional and never a doubt I can be heard clearly.
Clear Webcam: Looking sharp in every meeting, plus you can see my dog in 1080.

## FINAL THOUGHTS
It’s worth making an investment in your remote setup so you have the tools and equipment to stay focused, work comfortably, and collaborate effectively with others.

13 LINKEDIN SETTINGS YOU MUST OPTIMIZE TO AVOID BEING FILTERED OUT OF THE RESUME PILE 

OVERVIEW 
LinkedIn is your most valuable tool in your remote job search. It's where you can find 
jobs, network, create content, engage, and show off your experience. Your LinkedIn is 
your ‘landing page’ for employers, potential collaborators, and recruiters, and it's no 
secret: they are all looking at it! Along with a complete profile, it's important to 
optimize specific parts of your settings so you avoid being filtered out when 
applying. These hacks, while small, can be the difference between you getting 
noticed and getting ignored. Use this PDF as a guide of settings you can immediately 
change to increase your chances of success in your search. Disclaimer: LinkedIn 
changes their user experience frequently. If something doesn't look the same as the 
picture, they may have changed the setting or it may be in a different area.

Job postings have a list of skills 
required for job applicants. If you 
apply for that job, one factor taken 
into account is how well you match the 
skills of that listing. So, before you 
apply to any job, make sure you add 
any missing skills to your LinkedIn 
profile on that listing (without lying). 
To add a skill just go to your profile, 
scroll down and press "Add a new 
skill" in the "Skills and Endorsements” 
section. You will show up in a different 
filter to recruiters depending on how 
well you match, so this is crucial!

Always follow the company pages for the roles you're targeting. 
They can tell how long you've been following, as well, so it's a 
good idea to follow many remote companies in the niche you're 
interested. You can find more similar companies to those you like 
by looking at the "Similar pages” column on the right side of any 
company page. 
13. ALWAYS RESPOND TO RECRUITERS

No thanks Yes 
If a recruiter ever reaches out to you for a role, ALWAYS 
respond. It's your chance to build a relationship, even if 
it's not the right fit for you, plus it signals LinkedIn's 
algorithm that you are responsive to job inquiries.
