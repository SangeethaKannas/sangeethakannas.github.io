## Remote job search
Master Your Remote Job Search 
If you’ve spent any time looking for a remote job, you’ve likely run into at least one of these problems:
: You struggle to find legitimate, well-pa#ing remote opportunities"
: You’re under-qualified for most of the remote job postings #ou find"
: You feel overqualified for the remote job postings #ou’re finding"
: You send out dozens, even hundreds of applications without getting an# responses"
: When #ou do make it to the interview phase, #ou struggle to articulate #our value"
: Where #ou live is an obstacle since man# remote jobs have geographical restrictions.
Being good at your job and being good at the job search are two different skill sets. 
Most people suck at searching for a remote job because they’ve never been taught how to do it!

My goal is to help you create a system for searching, finding, and getting hired by remote companies, as well as to identify the types of remote companies that will allow you to live your ideal lifestyle.
