
Clean Code

	Error Handling
naming - what is the purpose of the function
Flags - about what is the function doing

No more than two args
Single reponsibility to functions : Very important

Simulates private functions in ES 5 -->
	can be replaced with classes in ES 6

Same Vocabulary
	For Eg., If we use 'getxxxData' - then only data should be used, not 'getxxxInfo or getxxxProps' etc.,
	there is no need on re-inforcing concepts user.name instead of user.userName

Constants should be explained 
Specify return types and parameter types
