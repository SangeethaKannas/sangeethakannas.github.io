Attitude

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team

According to the book, the five dysfunctions are:[4]

●	Absence of trust—unwilling to be vulnerable within the group
●	Fear of conflict—seeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate
●	Lack of commitment—feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization
●	Avoidance of accountability—ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards
●	Inattention to results—focusing on personal success, status and ego before team success
