How to jolt yourself out of a rut  (and redesign your life):

It's normal in life to feel like you are in a rut. 
Many destructive aspects in our society can creep up onyou: 
* Burnout 
+ Lack of purpose 
+ Constant dopamine exposure 
They slowly stack up and compound over 
time.
|  & 
We begin to feel the effects without 
understanding the root cause: 
+ Brain fog 
+ Lack of motivation 
+ Constantly distracted / unable to achieve 
flow state 
We start to get frustrated and unfulfilled 
with our own lifestyle and performance. 
Here's how I would reboot my life:

1. Practice a Brain Dump 
Answer these 3 questions: 
* What time of day do I feel worst at? 
* What do I fall asleep stressed about? 
* What aspects of my life am I most frustrated with? 
Follow these rules: 
+ Stream of consciousness writing 
* 15 minutes per response
 
2. Follow the "3 Level" Framework 
Start being more analytical — dig 3 levels 
deep for every response. 
IE: 
What time of day do I feel worst at? 
— What is my current morning/night 
routine? 
— What tasks are consistently low energy 
inducing? 
— How do Tknow I feel "worst"?

3. Synthesize Outtakes 
Your end goal with this exercise: 
Identify 10-15 root causes behind your 
currentrut. 
+ "Checking TikTok 2 hours after dinner" 
+ "Having 15-minute sales calls spread 
throughout the day" 
+ "Delegation is stressing me out more than 
reducing workload."

4. Address/Eliminate 
Be ruthless in protecting your energy levels. 
Either: 
1. Build an effective improvement plan (ie. 
setting time restrictions, doing a dopamine 
detox etc.) 
2.Remove the practice altogether.

5. Create Your Dream Week 
Reducing your distractions will create a 
massive vacuum of free time. 
Be intentional about your dream week so no 
distractions creep up on you. 
+ Ideal daily requirements 
+ Weekly goals/outcomes
 
It's very easy for life to creep up on you. 
Build pillars against this from happening: 
* Monthly audits 
+ Ideal dream week 
* Morning/evening routines 
+ Habit creation systems 
1t'll take weeks of experimentation/ 
optimization, but the end resultis 
unbeatable.
