Harsh truth from Hardwards 85 years study of Happiness

# The worlds Longest study of happiness 
85 years.
That's how long The Harvard Study of Adult Development has been running.
Directed by Robert Waldinger.
The study has helped provide priceless insights into human happiness:
The World’s Longest Study of Happiness
## 1. The key to a happy life is quality relationships
Not wealth, not fame.
—Relationships.
It's not the only thing that matters, but time and time again this proved to be the biggest factor.

## 2. Loneliness is deadly
Loneliness leads to chronic stress.
This can have a similar effect on our health as smoking half a pack of cigarettes per day.


## 3 Being introverted is  not a disadvantage
For relationships:
Quality > Quantity
The study shows that even 1 or 2 close connections is sufficient.
Introversion can even be an ADVANTAGE.
As introverts may not require as many connections to feel fulfilled.

## 4. Social media can be a double-edged sword

Connection = more happiness
Comparison = less happiness
Using social media to make genuine connections with others can create fulfillment in your life.
If you're using it to doomscroll—not so much.

## 5. Purpose > Payment
Purpose is powerful. 
People who have purpose in their work, experience greater life satisfaction and happiness.
—Whether paid or unpaid.
If your career doesn't provide these feelings—try volunteering for a cause you're passionate about.

## 6. Taking care of your health is crucial
"A healthy man wants a thousand things — a sick man wants only one."
Unsurprisingly, the people in good health
reported much higher levels of life-satisfaction.

## 7. It’s never too late to improve your happiness

50s, 60s, 70s.
It doesn't matter.
Many individuals reported overhauling their happiness late in life after taking conscious action to  improve it.
Think it's too late to be happy? — Think again.

But what about money?
Yes, money impacts our happiness.
But only up to a point.
Better to think of money as a tool that gives us security and a sense of control over our lives, rather than a solution to all of our problems.
