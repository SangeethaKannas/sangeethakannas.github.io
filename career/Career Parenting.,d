A thread
1
Comparison
We are often compared to others, in the hope
that it elevates our game.
However, the constant comparison makes us
feel that nothing we do will be good enough.
Because there will always be someone to
compare ourselves with!
2
Killing curiosity
As kids all that we did was ask questions.
Before we were told not to.
Asking means we do not understand.
Asking means we are dumb.
Asking means we admit to being dumb.
So don't ask.
We stop asking.
We memorize answers.
Instead of loving questions.
3
Focusing on society
Society is somehow more important than us.
What we do in life, who we marry, how we dress,
where we work.
Decisions that should be ours, become decisions
driven by others. Faceless people, who opinions
are apparently more important than our feelings.

Looking at the world only through
their own experiences
Our parents had a very different and difficult life.
Which, for no fault of theirs, has biased them.
The world has changed though.
Their biases haven't.
5
Emotional blackmail
"You can do what you want to do. You do not
have to think about us."
This sentence has stopped more kids from taking
the decision, than any fear or laziness combined.
6
Dismissing mental health
Mental health wasn't a topic for our parents,
growing up. People were sent to mental
hospitals.
So it is easy for them to dismiss mental health
as either a fad ("you can come out of it if you
want to") or a illness to be ashamed of.
7
Lack of trust
In a trust-deficient society, parents tend to start
with mistrust than trust.
"Daal mein kuch kaala hai" (there is something
wrong) is the operative we are raised on.
We are rarely trusted.
So we grow up to rarely trust.
8
No discussion about money
Most of us grow up with zero understanding of
income, expenses, taxes, investments.
And thus have a complicated relationship with
money that we understand much later.
By which time it is often late.
9
Unreasonable expectations
Because our parents had a difficult different life,
they often wish to experience life through their
kids.
Thus imposing expectations that we did not get
to chose for ourselves.
What is success for us, is often defined without
our permission.
10
Imposing relationships
We are often ordered to maintain relationships,
simply because we were born into them.
Even if those relationships do not work for us.
Thus a lot of us grow up with a complicated
relationship with our own selves.
"Is there something wrong with me?"
11
Not making us accountable
When we fail, we are either blamed, or we are
absolved of it because it was someone else's
fault.
When we fall as a toddler, it is the floor that is
beaten up.
So we rarely grow up to take responsibility for
our actions.
This thread can easily be treated as one
against parents.
It is not.
Our parents had an immensely hard,
demanding life.
Survival was key.
They lived a life trying to just make ends
meet. Life didn't have options.
So most of how they parented us, was driven by
what worked for them.
While those ways may not work anymore, do
remember that they most certainly want the
same things for your life that you want for yours.
It is the worldview that differs.
Not the outcome.
This thread is meant to make you aware how
your parents, for no fault of theirs, could
impact you as an individual.
And for parents to be aware of how their
actions drive an entire life.
It baffles me how little people are taught about
parenting and how critical and sensitive a role it
plays in shaping the entire world.
It baffles me how many of us grow up loving our
parents but eventually resenting them as we
discover how they influenced us adversely.
Both of these can change.
Kids: Start by understanding WHY parents
behave the way they do. Appreciate where they
come from.
Parents: Recognize that there are multiple ways
to get to the same outcome. Trust your kids to
experiment, fail and figure their own way.
"Parents are first humans.
By treating them as gods, we treat them unfairly.
Each time they fail, we question them. When we
should instead understand them."
"Kids are their parent's replica.
They can either give them their values. Or make
them live their life. It's a choice."
