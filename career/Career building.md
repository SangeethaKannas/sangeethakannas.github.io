you should be smart enough to realize this... By the age of 21

1. Your 9-5 is someone's passive  income. Find new ways to make money and create yours. 
2. Distraction is the greatest Killer of success. It stunts and destroys your brain.
3. You shouldn't take advice from people who're not where you want to be in life. 
4. No one is coming to save your problems. Your life is 100% your responsibility.
5. If you find someone smarter than you, work with them, don't compete. 
6. Stop smoking for your mental health. Smoking actually increases anxiety and tension, slows your thinking, and lowers your focus.
7. Comfort is the worst addiction and a cheap ticket to depression. 
8. Don't tell people more than they need to know, respect your privacy.
9. Keep your standards high and don't settle for something because it's available. 
10. The family you create is more important than the family you come from. 
11. Train yourself to take nothing personally to save yourself from 99% of mental problems.
