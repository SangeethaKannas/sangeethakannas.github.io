## Recruitment tips

1. Recruiters are busy people. They rely heavily on search. So please make sure your profile is easy for them to find -  include relevant keywords for your profession.

2. For the last job include more than just the title. Please add responsibilities and how you made a difference there.

3. Please consider atttaching your resume to your profile, but don't include any personal information such as phone, address, etc. They can be used by scammers. Recruiters know how to find you, anyway.

If you would like me to view your profile for additional feedback,  please give this post a like and a comment.
