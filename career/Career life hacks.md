# LIFE HACKS

01 SCARED OF SAYING NO TO PEOPLE?
Instead of saying no (or worse, saying
yes), ask for permission to say no.
"Is it ok if I say no?"
Most people will accept your no, this way.
02
PEOPLE THINK YOU ARE
SELF OBSESSED?
Whenever someone shares anything
about their life, resist the urge to
share your own experience around
it, unless asked.
Avoid "me too"
,
"I also do this"
,
"I was thinking exactly the same".
03
DO NOT DEAL WELL
WITH FAILURE?
Practice failing.
Everyday, pick up a task that is not
significant, but has a high chance of
failure. And do it.
Ask strangers for money.
Send cold emails.
Within 30 days, you will start dealing
with failure a lot better.
04
STRUGGLE TO MANAGE YOUR
DOCS AND THOUGHTS?
Create a WhatsApp group with
you and a friend.
Delete the friend.
Now the group has only you.
Pin the group to the top.
Use this group for sharing thoughts,
capturing images, voice notes to
yourself, whatever you want it to be!
05
STRUGGLE TO EXPRESS
GRATITUDE?
Keep a gratitude jar
Everyday, before going to bed, write
down something that you are grateful
for. Anything at all.
Place it in the jar.
In moments of weakness,
go through the notes.
06
WANT PEOPLE TO
LIKE YOU?
Repeat what they said, back to them.
"To make sure I heard you right,
you are saying XXX (repeat what
they said)"
They feel heard, they respect your
listening skills - the mirroring helps.
07
STRUGGLE TO
INVEST?
Whenever you spend on anything
that is a desire/wish (clothes, phone,
eating out etc), transfer an
equivalent amount to a separate
bank account.
This way you will enjoy your present,
while planning for the future.
08
WASTE A LOT OF TIME
ON THE PHONE?
Schedule "waste" time on your
calendar, just as you would
schedule your productive hours.
Your brain anticipates it, looks
forward to it and treats it as reward.
+ BONUS TIP
Put time blockers on the apps you
waste most time on.
Let your family/friend lock it with a
PIN, which they do not share with you.
09 FEEL UNDER-CONFIDENT?
Trick your mind with powerful
reinforcements.
Instead of saying "I think" or "I am
not sure" say "I believe" or "I am
certain".
10
WANT TO LEARN
SOMETHING?
Teach it to somebody else.
It works, even if you are fake
teaching (recording yourself,
while you teach)
11
STRUGGLE WITH
PROCRASTINATION?
Think of the task you have to finish,
right before you go to sleep. Better
still, think of the end of the task.
Your brain will mentally start mapping
the path to finish it. Once up, this will
make it easier for you to finish the task
12
LOSE PEOPLE'S
ATTENTION EASILY?
While speaking to them, include
their name in your sentences.
We instantly react to our names,
thus bringing our attention back to
the conversation.
13
STRUGGLE TO FOCUS WHILE
LISTENING TO MUSIC?
Any song with lyrics will take our
attention away.
Instead, listen to instrumental
music (ideally classical music).
14
CAUGHT IN OFFICE
POLITICS?
Compliment people behind their
back. The news will eventually
travel to them.
People find it hard to fight people
who compliment them.
15
BUY THINGS AND
THEN REGRET?
If unsure whether you should buy
it or not, wait for 30 days and
then ask yourself if you still need
the thing.
Quite likely you won't anymore.
16
STRUGGLE TO QUOTE
YOUR PRICE?
Share a specific price, as against
a round figure. 1.47 seems like a
legitimate, thought-through number
as against 1.5.
17
STRUGGLE TO WAKE
UP EARLY?
Set your alarm 10 minutes earlier
than your current wake up time.
Do it for 3 weeks. Then 10 mins
earlier. 3 weeks again.
Slowly work your way through to
your desired wake-up time.
Our mind can easily be tricked!
The question is, what do we trick it for? Over
40+ years of existence, I have deployed these
tricks to my advantage and can vouch for how
massively effective they are, as compared to
the effort needed.
