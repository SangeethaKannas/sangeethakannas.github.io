Behavioral Interviews are taken to evaluate a
candidate's past behavior or
conduct in certain different
situations to analyze/predict
their future behavior
towards the future
employer.
 
Introduction
Common
Myths
regarding
Behavioral
Interviews
 
 
Many candidates treat
Behavioral Interviews to be
easy and simple to crack. The
reality is these interviews are
often complex and very dense
if not prepared well.
Myth #1 - Are Simple
Interviews
 
Many candidates believe that
Behavioral Interviews are just
for formality. The reality is
these interviews can generate
red flags based on your
answers and can reject your
whole candidature even if
other interviews have gone
well.
Myth #2 - Formality
/ No Rejection
 
It is believed that Behavioral
Interviews can be prepared a
day before the actual interview.
The reality is even though we
know what questions can be
asked, the complexity and
rejection often come from the
follow-up questions. Thus,
sufficient time needs to be
invested in its preparation.
Myth #3 - Can be
prepared in a day

Leadership
Principles
 
 
Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the
customer and work
backwards. They work
vigorously to earn and
keep customer trust.
Although leaders pay
attention to competitors,
they obsess over
customers.
 
Ownership
Leaders are owners. They
think long-term and don’t
sacrifice long-term value
for short-term results.
They act on behalf of the
entire company, beyond
just their own team. They
never say “that’s not my
job.
”
 
Invent and Simplify
Leaders expect and require
innovation and invention from
their teams and always find
ways to simplify. They are
externally aware, look for new
ideas from everywhere, and
are not limited by “not
invented here.
” As we do new
things, we accept that we may
be misunderstood for long
periods of time.
 
Are Right, A Lot
Leaders are right a lot.
They have strong
judgment and good
instincts. They seek
diverse perspectives
and work to disconfirm
their beliefs.
 
Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done
learning and always seek
to improve themselves.
They are curious about
new possibilities and act
to explore them.
 
Hire and Develop the
Best
Leaders raise the performance
bar with every hire and
promotion. They recognize
exceptional talent, and willingly
move them throughout the
organization. Leaders develop
leaders and take seriously their
role in coaching others. We
work on behalf of our people to
invent mechanisms for
development like Career Choice.
 
Insist on the Highest
Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high
standards — many people may
think these standards are
unreasonably high. Leaders are
continually raising the bar and
drive their teams to deliver high
quality products, services, and
processes. Leaders ensure that
defects do not get sent down
the line and that problems are
fixed so they stay fixed.
 
Think Big
Thinking small is a selffulfilling prophecy.
Leaders create and
communicate a bold
direction that inspires
results. They think
differently and look
around corners for ways
to serve customers.
 
Bias for Action
Speed matters in
business. Many
decisions and actions
are reversible and do
not need extensive
study. We value
calculated risk taking.
 
Frugality
Accomplish more with
less. Constraints breed
resourcefulness, selfsufficiency, and
invention. There are no
extra points for growing
headcount, budget size,
or fixed expense.
 
Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively,
speak candidly, and treat
others respectfully. They are
vocally self-critical, even
when doing so is awkward or
embarrassing. Leaders do not
believe their or their team’s
body odor smells of perfume.
They benchmark themselves
and their teams against the
best.
 
Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all
levels, stay connected
to the details, audit
frequently, and are
skeptical when metrics
and anecdote differ.
No task is beneath
them.
 
Have Backbone;
Disagree and Commit
Leaders are obligated to
respectfully challenge decisions
when they disagree, even when
doing so is uncomfortable or
exhausting. Leaders have
conviction and are tenacious.
They do not compromise for
the sake of social cohesion.
Once a decision is determined,
they commit wholly.
 
Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key
inputs for their business
and deliver them with
the right quality and in a
timely fashion. Despite
setbacks, they rise to
the occasion and never
settle.
 
Story Preparation
Take the above
leadership principles and
prepare 1-2 experience
stories around it using
the method. It will
cover most of your
Behavioral Interview
Questions. For eg. (my)
 
Customer Obsession
Situation - I had just joined
XYZ company and was
assigned to a project that was
already in the development
phase for 6 months. The UI
presented a screen to the
Client for uploading
documents. The UI showed all
uploaded documents on UI,
along with their metadata.
 
Customer Obsession
Initially, it worked fine due to
the limited no. of documents.
As the documents increased in
the system, this started
making UI slower and slower.
Soon, the problem became
evident to the client and the
team was asked about
probable solutions.
 
Customer Obsession
Task - Looking at the problem I
created a few tasks that can
tackle the problem efficiently
such as,
Improving the performance
of UI. (Rendering of grid)
Improving the performance
of backend logic.
Optimizing the queries that
get us the data.
 
Customer Obsession
Handling and storage of the
document blob efficiently
(upload/download/store)
Improving the search, sorting
and filters on UI.
 
Customer Obsession
Action - Taking up tasks step
by step, we implemented
various improvements such as,
Implemented Client Side
Pagination. Instead, of
rendering all the documents
on UI, we paginated it to
show a max of 10-20
records. This made rendering
of UI faster.
 
Customer Obsession
Implemented Server Side
Pagination to make queries
faster to fetch limited data.
Implemented Document blob
fetching/preview on user
action, instead of fetching
along with document
metadata. The idea was to
show only document metadata
and interested document
preview was done via
download API.
 
Customer Obsession
Implemented filters, search,
and sorting along with
paginated queries i.e.
removed all the UI
processing to the backend.
Initially, the Document blob
was stored in a database. It
resulted in slowness of
queries. Later, we migrated it
to a blob storage solution.
 
Customer Obsession
Result - After implementing the
above actions step by step, it
resulted in a drastic
improvement in the
performance of the system. The
queries which took almost 1
minute to fetch the data of X
no. of documents, now took
nearly 1 sec. The clients were
happy and it resulted in trust
and new initiatives for the
future.
