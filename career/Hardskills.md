Public speaking is a skill, and it is an 
asset that will last for years. You may feel 
uncomfortable doing it because it is a 
skill that can't be learned in a day. 
With persistence and consistency, you 
will become perfect in it, and it will pay 
off in the future.

2. Managing Your Time 
Being busy DOESN'T mean effective! We 
are busier than any other generation in the 
last 300-400 years. 
Challenge your schedule and ask yourself 
if you're effective - are you mostly focusing 
on the things you "have" to do or the 
things you're "Created" to do?

3. Having Empathy 
" You can be the most disciplined, 
brilliant, and even wealthy individual in 
the world, but if you don't care for or 
empathize with other people, then you 
are basically nothing but a sociopath. "

We must learn to stop whining about 
what will happen, what will never 
happen, what we have and do not have, 
what somebody did or didn't do. Practice 
a life of no whining, no criticizing, and no 
complaining.

7. Focus on the Present Moment 
Being in the present moment is where you 
will have the greatest control, where you will 
feel the most at ease, and where happiness 
flourishes. 
There is a super tight connection between 
happiness and the ability to live in the 
present moment. 
Staying present is the skill of having your 
mind in the moment, not in the past, not in 
the future, but right here.

action but a continuous process. There is 
no time to mourn over your failures 
because this wastes time, but just pick 
yourself up and keep moving on.

of consistency is a journey.
