# Inspiration
I have always wondered why we have many job seekers; however, businesses struggle to find the right talent?

Why are we the IT services capital of the world but have failed to produce a successful global product made in India?

Finally, our school education system is extensive in reach and numbers; however, why are we still focused on knowledge rather than how to put it to use?

Are these linked? Can we unlock the true potential of India, and it's human capital? However, to do that, we need to think carefully about three India's that live in our schools.

First, the Aspirational India - Where foundational education often falters amidst myriad challenges.

Second, the Hungry Middle India, where Knowledge is sought but often merely memorised, not applied.

Finally, the Privileged India that has abundant resources.

Unlocking India‚Äôs human capital needs a different approach for each subgroup. If we catch them young and fix it at school, the $5 trillion goal would be easier to reach.


## Trial and Error
The hardest pill to swallow is that the best way to learn isn't from reading books or Linkedin posts... üíä

It's from trial and error. That's especially hard because:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Trial goes far beyond the consumption of content.
It takes doing the work.
It requires action.

2Ô∏è‚É£ And as for error?
Think about how much you hate to fail.
Think about the times you haven't even started due to fear of failure.

Yet doing something, struggling, and trying again and again is the only true way to learn.

For yourself.

That's not to say that reading books and consuming content from others isn't helpful. There's absolutely amazing takeaways and inspiration from all of that.

But said content is only relevant to them.

It's a path that has worked for them.

But whether it works for you?
