## Life hacks
When you think something nice about 
someone, let them know. 
It's a shame that we often wait until a 
person's funeral to say all of the nice 
things we thought about them. 
The next time you have a positive thought 
about someone—tell them right then.

Record a video interview with your 
parents. 
Ask them questions and have them tell 
stories about their childhood, adventures, 
hopes, dreams, and fears. 
Our time with them is finite, but we often 
fail to recognize it until it's too late. 
These recordings will last forever.

Go for a 15 minute walk every morning. 
You don't need a fancy morning routine— 
just go for a walk. 
The sunlight, movement, and fresh air 
have a direct positive impact on your 
mood, circadian rhythm, metabolism, 
digestion, and more. 
Leave the phone at home. Let your mind 
wander.

Reread your favorite books annually. 
You may read thousands of books in your 
life, but there will only be a few that 
deeply change you. 
Reread them every single year. 
Your experience with the book will change 
as you do—you'll pick up new 
perspectives. 
It's beautiful.

Set your emails to have a 60 second 
delay before sending. 
You notice most mistakes immediately 
after hitting send—the delay allows you 
to catch them. 
Also, if you're sending an email in the 
heat of the moment, the delay lets you 
cool off and reassess if it's worth it.

If you want to get better at anything, do it 
for 30 minutes per day for 30 straight 
days. 
It's easy to over-engineer progress—a bit 
of dedicated effort each day is all you 
need. 
900 minutes of accumulated effort is 
enough to make dramatic improvements 
at literally anything.

In your 20s and 30s, do a few things that 
you'll be excited to tell your kids about 
someday. 
Go on an adventure, train for some wild 
event, get your hands dirty on a crazy 
project, whatever. 
Create a few stories worth telling.

Batch email processing into condensed 
windows. 
Depending on your industry, it may be 
anywhere from 1-3 windows per day. 
Parkinson's Law says that work expands 
to fill the time available for its 
completion. Force a time constraint on 
low-value tasks to get them done 
efficiently.

Invest in personalized stationary and use 
it regularly. 
Emails and texts lack personality. 
Good penmanship and a handwritten 
note will always stand out. 
Handwritten notes are an "old fashioned" 
thing that should definitely make a 
comeback.

Tell your partner one thing you appreciate about them every single day. 
As time passes in any relationship, it 
becomes easy to take the good for 
granted. 
Don't fall into this trap. 
Highlight the good!
p
Make a rule to never think twice about 
investments in yourself. 
- Books 
« Quality food 
« Fitness 
- Personal development 
These investments pay dividends for a 
long time. 
Think about material purchases instead— wait 48 hours to complete an order to see if you still want it.

Take yourself out for a meal alone once each month. 
- Carry a notebook and pen 
« Bring your favorite book 
- No phone or technology 
Let your mind run free. Flex that boredom 
muscle. 
It’s insanely freeing—a meditative experience.

When you're starting your career, swallow the frog for your boss to get ahead. 
(1) Observe your boss 
(2) Figure out what they hate doing 
(3) Learn to do it 
(4) Take it off their plate 
It's an easy way to add value, put up a win, and build momentum.

When someone is going through hell, just 
saying “I’m with you” is the most 
powerful thing you can do. 
Advice, perspectives, or offers to help are 
minimally impactful. 
The notion that someone is with you is 
10x more powerful. 
Be the “darkest hour friend” to those you 
love.

When you're trying to learn something 
new, attempt to teach it to a friend or 
family member. 
See what questions they ask and how 
those questions expose the gaps in your 
knowledge. 
Study more to fill in those gaps. 
The act of teaching is the most powerful 
form of learning.

Send a letter to your future self once 
each year. 
- Reflect on the present 
- Changes you want to make 
- Goals for the future 
Use an online tool to have it sent in a 1-5 
years. 
You'll benefit from the reflection in the present and the smiles when you open them in the future.

If someone tries to put down your accomplishments, cut them out of your life. 
These people are "boat anchors"—they 
try to hold you back and create a drag on your progress. 
Distance yourself from anyone who spends time bringing others down or dismissing their achievements.

Have at least one thing in your life that you are bad at (but love doing). 
Ambitious, driven people tend to do everything with some specific end in mind. 
It's wonderfully refreshing to do something just for the sake of doing it.

Those are 20+ powerful life hacks that I've found.

# Stay further ahead
## You are letting go of grudges

Holding a grudge is like holding a hot coal  with no one to throw it at. 
Growth is realizing that forgiveness isn’t about letting the other person off the hook. 
It’s about freeing yourself

You know your hard work is paying off when  your comfort zone starts to expand. 
New skills. New knowledge. New confidence.

You’re leveling up, and it shows.
Your expanded comfort zone is the direct result of getting out of it more often. 
A healthy dose of stress helps you grow as a person, just as it helps your muscles grow in the gym. 
When in doubt, let discomfort be your compass. 

## You are not trying to impress others
External validation is like sea water. 
The more you drink, the thirstier you become. 
The only two people you should worry about making proud are your 8-year-old self, and your 80-year-old self. 
The rest is just noise.

## You are being more vulnerable
Vulnerability is strength. 
Sharing your work. 
Sharing your story. 
Sharing your hopes, dreams, and fears. 
It shows you’re becoming more comfortable in your own skin, and it will allow others to connect with you on a deeper level.

## You are changing your mind
It’s hard to let go of long-held values. 
A clear sign of growth is when you challenge the beliefs and opinions that have been conditioned into ou from a young age. 
Open your mind. 
Question everything. 
And remember it’s ok to say “I don’t know”.

## You're patient with results and impatient with actions

Want massive success in life?

Plan as if you’ll live for the next 100 years.
